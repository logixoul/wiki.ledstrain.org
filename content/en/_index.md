#### What is LEDStrain?

The [Forum](https://ledstrain.org/) and Wiki are here to help with **the impact light-emitting devices have on our health** - particularly eye health.  
Both are free to use and can use your participation!


#### Contributing to the wiki

There are two ways: **via the convenient page editor Netlify** ([click here](https://wiki.ledstrain.org/contribute/)), or **directly on GitHub** (click on the "Edit this page" link on any wiki page). More details - [here](ledstrain#contributing).

Don't forget: you can embed any forum post directly into a wiki page [via shortcodes](ledstrain#forum-post-embed)! ðŸ™‚
