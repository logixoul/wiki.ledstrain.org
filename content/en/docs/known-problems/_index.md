# Common Solutions

## Common (generic) solutions for any kind of screen

* [**Eye patching**](https://ledstrain.org/d/1308-one-eye-success-for-10-users-on-ledstrain). Fully blocking out one eye with an opaque eyepatch has helped a surprising number of forum members.
* [**Go to a Binocular Vision Disorder (BVD) specialist**](https://ledstrain.org/d/1308-one-eye-success-for-10-users-on-ledstrain/81) to get checked for BVD. If you get a BVD diagnostic, ask for "prism lenses" (a special type of eyeglasses meant for BVD sufferers).
* [**PWM**](https://iristech.co/pwm-flicker/) (Pulse Width Modulation) means that the display is flickering in a particular way (in order to regulate brightness). Set your display's hardware brightness to 100% and instead regulate brightness in a software way with apps like f.lux or Iris. Software dimming doesn't produce PWM.
* [**Temporal Dithering**](https://ledstrain.org/d/152-temporal-dithering-sensitivity-my-solution) (TD) means a device (display, videocard...) cannot display some of the necessary shades, so it chooses the two nearest shades, and flickers between them very fast instead. On Windows (Intel GPUs), this can be disabled via [ditherig.exe](http://kawamoto.no-ip.org/henteko/myapp_en.html).
* **Minimal brightness is too high**: There are many apps that can apply a black filter to the screen and thus reduce the screen brightness below the minimal system brightness. [For Android](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/14), some such apps are Screen Dimmer, Screen Filter, Darker, Twilight. [For Windows](https://www.nelsonpires.com/software/dimmer), one such app is Dimmer.

## Common (generic) solutions for smartphones

* **Problems with auto brightness**: [Try turning off auto brightness and adjusting it manually](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/92), or [install a third-party application from Google Play](https://ledstrain.org/d/21-usable-smartphones/1943).


## Common (generic) solutions for computers

* [**Not sharp enough font, anti-aliasing problems**](https://ledstrain.org/d/47-anti-aliased-fonts-can-damage-eyesight-writeup): There may be problems with font anti-aliasing or ClearType. This can be turned off via [SwitchResX](https://heteroforie.webnode.cz/l/apps-to-ease-the-symptoms-of-heterophoria/) (on Mac).
