title: Problems with monitors/laptops (light/backlight/screen parts-related)
---
## 1. Undefined problem X
Something in light that affects vergence. Complaints often include piercing white colour, inability to set up a pleasant brightness (screen always feels too bright), and inability to focus on a screen.   
Presumably connected to inner screen parts.  
[Hypothesis here](https://ledstrain.org/d/1458-ips-screen-parts-description-and-dangerous-parts-hypothesis-lightvergence/2)  
- [Post where removal of BEF (or similar) layer reduced symptoms with 5 screens](https://ledstrain.org/d/513-removing-the-metalic-semi-transparent-lcd-layer-helps)  
- [Post where a change of polarizer and BEF removal helped partially](https://ledstrain.org/d/1458-ips-screen-parts-description-and-dangerous-parts-hypothesis-lightvergence/2)

## 2. Excessive blue light 
There are some reports that reducing blue light helps, but sometimes not for 100%.  
To limit the blue spectrum from the entire screen - optics have glasses with a blue-blocking filter.

## 3. Rough matte coating  
Up to personal preferences. Sometimes can cause more than discomfort.

## 4. Screen is too glossy
Up to personal preferences. Sometimes can cause more than discomfort.

## 5. Minimal brightness is too high
It can affect you if there's not enough lighting in the place where you use a monitor, or if you work at night/without light.
